# OOP 

A C++ and Python repository showcasing Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

# Description

This repository demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in both C++ and Python. It includes code examples, explanations, and potentially test cases to illustrate the concepts of classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more.

This project is ideal for:

* Beginners learning OOP
* Programmers looking to refresh their OOP skills
* Anyone interested in exploring OOP concepts in C++ and Python

## Installation

Before you can start using this project, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies:

**For C++:**

* A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)

**For Python:**

* Python (version 3.x recommended)

**Optional Dependencies:**

* (List any additional tools or libraries needed)

Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can navigate to the project directory and compile/run the code as needed (provide specific instructions based on your project setup).

## Usage

**C++ Examples:**

* Compile the C++ code using your preferred compiler (e.g., `g++ main.cpp -o my_program`).
```c++
g++ main.cpp -o your_program  # Compile
./your_program  # Run
```
* Run the compiled executable (e.g., `./my_program`).
```python
python main.py  # Run the script
python main.py input.txt output.csv  # Example with arguments
```

**Python Examples:**

* Run the Python scripts directly using the Python interpreter (e.g., `python my_script.py`).
