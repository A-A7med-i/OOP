# Demo Folder

This folder contains various subfolders and files related to a software project. Here's an overview:

## Subfolders:

1. **AbstractClasses:**
   - Contains abstract classes used for defining common interfaces.
     - `AbstractAnimal` (C++): Defines common behavior for various animal subclasses.
     - `AbstractShape` (Python): Defines common properties for different shapes.

2. **Constructor:**
   - Includes classes and code related to constructors.
     - `Person` (C++) and `Person` (Python): Demonstrates constructor usage (Note: Same class name used in both languages for demonstration purposes).

3. **Encapsulation:**
   - Illustrates data protection principles.
     - `Point` (C++): Encapsulates x and y coordinates of a point.
     - `Calculator` (Python): Encapsulates calculation logic and exposes methods for operations.

4. **Inheritance:**
   - Explores inheritance relationships.
     - `Car` (C++): Serves as a base for specialized behavior (e.g., `Animal`) and additional attributes (e.g., `Student`).

5. **Polymorphism:**
   - Showcases polymorphism.
     - `Animal` (C++): Includes various animal subclasses that might have different sounds.
     - `Animal` (Python): Demonstrates runtime method selection based on object type.

6. **Static:**
   - Explores static methods/variables.
     - C++:
       - `MathUtils` and `Counter`: Provide static utility functions and a counter class.
       - `MyClass`: Demonstrates using static methods/variables within a class.
     - Python:
       - `Counter` and `MathHelper`: Provide static functions for counting and mathematical operations.
       - `MyClass`: Demonstrates using static methods/variables within a class.
