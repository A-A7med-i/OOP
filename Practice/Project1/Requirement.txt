• Hospital System Implementation:

• There are 20 different specializations (e.g., Pediatrics, Surgery, etc.).

• Each specialization has only 5 available spots in a queue.

• When adding a patient:
    ◦ Read their name and status (0 = regular; 1 = urgent).
    ◦ If the requested specialization doesn’t exist, apologize and don’t accept.
    ◦ If the patient is regular, add them to the end of the queue; otherwise, add them to the beginning.

• To print patients for specializations with waiting patients:
    ◦ Display the patients in the queue.

• When a doctor picks up a patient:
    ◦ Read the requested specialization.
    ◦ If no patients exist, inform the doctor.
    ◦ Otherwise, ask the patient to go with the doctor and remove them from the queue.
