# OOP Tasks

Welcome to the OOP Tasks folder! Here, you'll find solutions to various programming tasks related to Object-Oriented Programming. Whether you're practicing inheritance, encapsulation, or polymorphism, this folder contains code snippets in both C++ and Python.

## Folder Structure:

- **cpp/:** Contains C++ code files.
- **py/:** Contains Python code files.

## Task Descriptions:

1. **Task 1 (cpp/building.cpp and py/building.py):**
   - Description: Implement a class hierarchy for buildings.
   - Concepts: class properties (e.g., floors, area).


2. **Task 2 (cpp/invoice.cpp and py/invoice.py):**
   - Description: Simulate an invoice system for a business (e.g., products, quantities, prices).
   - Concepts: Polymorphism, abstract classes (e.g., Invoice base class).


## Getting Started:

Explore the code in the `cpp/` and `py/` folders.
